    A suffix trie node is composed of two things:

    1. A suffix link. Suppose the node n represents some suffix "xb", where
    x is a single character and b is a sequence of characters. A suffix link
    will link to a SuffixTrieNode p representing the suffix b. So if n is
    the string "abbaa", then it will point to a node representing the string
    "bbaa".

    Because every node in the graph represents the prefix to some suffix in
    the input string, we are guaranteed to have a valid suffix link for every
    node in the trie, except for the root.

    2. A set of edges to children SuffixTrieNode. Edges are mappings from
    character labels of the edge to SuffixTrieNode children. For example, if
    some SuffixTrieNode n represents the suffix "abcd" and has an edge
    mapping of 'e' => SuffixTrieNode p, then p represents the suffix
    "abcde".
